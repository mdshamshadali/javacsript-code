JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
It is most well-known as the scripting language for web pages, but it's also used in many other environments
such as Node.js for server-side development. JavaScript is a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS.

Best Practices
Code readability: Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
Avoid global variables: Keep the global namespace clean by using closures or modules.
Use let and const instead of var: Prevent scope issues and improve code readability.
Handle asynchronous code properly: Use Promises or async/await for cleaner code.
Modular code: Write modular, reusable code, and avoid long functions.
